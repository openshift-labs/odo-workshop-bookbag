`odo` is still in Beta stage. There is still a long way to go, but we're heavily working into making the experience better and making the tool more complete. Some things that are currently in our plans:

- Obviously fix any bug :-D
- Make the tool be aware of the shell's current directory, like Git does
- Provide global configuration for the tool
- Store component's configuration along with source code in Git
- Provide debugging capabilities `odo debug`
- Provide configuration capabilities for your components. `odo config`
- Provide usage information about your component: memory, cpu usage.
- And much more.

Check the project's GitHub repository [https://github.com/openshift/odo](https://github.com/openshift/odo) and contribute if you can, or give feedback if you use it.
