In this self-paced lab, you will learn how to use OpenShift Do (`odo`) to build and deploy applications on the OpenShift Container Platform.

## The Environment

During this lab, you will be using a hosted OpenShift environment that is created just for you. This environment is not shared with other users of the system. Because each user completing this lab has their own environment, we had to make some concessions to ensure the overall platform is stable and used only for this training. For that reason, your environment will only be active for 2.5 hours. Keep this in mind before you get started on the content. In addition, your session will time out after 15 minutes of inactivity. Each time you start this training, a new environment will be created on the fly.

This deployment is a self-contained environment that provides everything you need to be successful learning the platform. This includes a command line environment, the OpenShift web console, public URLs, and sample applications.

Let's get started!
